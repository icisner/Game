# Feed Reader Testing project

## About This Project
The idea of this project is given a web-based application which reads RSS feeds perform several tests using [Jasmine js](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction) Unit test. There is one basic test initially defined and six more has being asked to do to complete

## Getting Started
* To load the feed reader app with the jasmine specsheet simply clone this repository or create a pull request.Get more information about pull requests [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
* If you aren't comfortable with either of these, another option would be to simply download the zip file.
* Download or fork the application from [here.](https://github.com/22guille/feedReader)
* Select the index.html file to start the application.

## Requirement
The specsheet has been tested only on Chrome, so it is recommended that you use it for further testing and review.

## Diving in Deep
* If you want to write further tests you may do so, in the feedreader.js file in the spec subfolder of the jasmine folder.I have written some basic tests which address the basic functionality of the application, so if you want to test more, you'll have to add more features.
To write more tests you can refer to the jasmine framework documentation [here](https://22guille.github.io/feedReader/)
* The functionality of this app is implemented in app.js so you can use it to give it some more functionality.
